  - term: Logistic regression
    definition: |
      A regression model for binary outcomes that models the log-odds of an event as a linear function of predictors.
  - term: Binary outcome
    definition: |
      A response variable with two possible values, often coded as 0 and 1.
  - term: Probability
    definition: |
      A number between 0 and 1 that represents the chance of an event.
  - term: Odds
    definition: |
      The ratio of the probability of an event to the probability of it not occurring: p / (1 - p).
  - term: Logit
    definition: |
      The log of the odds: log(p / (1 - p)).
  - term: Link function
    definition: |
      A function that connects the mean of the response to the linear predictor; for logistic regression the link is the logit.
  - term: Linear predictor
    definition: |
      The linear combination of predictors, for example beta0 + beta1 x.
  - term: Coefficient
    definition: |
      A model parameter that describes how a predictor changes the log-odds, holding other predictors constant.
  - term: Odds ratio
    definition: |
      The multiplicative change in odds for a one-unit increase in a predictor; exp(coefficient).
  - term: Predicted probability
    definition: |
      The model's estimate of the probability of an event for a given set of predictors.
  - term: Likelihood
    definition: |
      A measure of how well a model explains the observed data; higher is better.
  - term: Deviance
    definition: |
      A goodness-of-fit measure based on the likelihood; lower is better.
  - term: Akaike Information Criterion
    definition: |
      A model comparison metric that balances fit and complexity; lower values indicate a preferred model among those compared.
    aliases:
      - AIC
  - term: Confusion matrix
    definition: |
      A table of predicted versus actual outcomes used to summarize classification performance.
  - term: Sensitivity
    definition: |
      The proportion of true positives correctly identified by the model.
  - term: Specificity
    definition: |
      The proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the model.
  - term: Accuracy
    definition: |
      The proportion of all predictions that are correct.
  - term: ROC curve
    definition: |
      A curve showing the trade-off between sensitivity and 1 - specificity across thresholds.
    aliases:
      - Receiver operating characteristic curve
  - term: AUC
    definition: |
      Area under the ROC curve; a summary of classification performance across thresholds.
  - term: Calibration
    definition: |
      How closely predicted probabilities match observed event rates.
  - term: Separation
    definition: |
      A situation where predictors perfectly separate outcomes, leading to unstable estimates.
  - term: Class imbalance
    definition: |
      When one outcome class is much more frequent than the other.
  - term: Interaction
    definition: |
      A term that allows the effect of one predictor to depend on another.
  - term: Factor
    definition: |
      A categorical predictor in R that is represented by discrete levels.
