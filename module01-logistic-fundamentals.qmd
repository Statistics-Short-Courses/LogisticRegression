## Learning outcomes

- Identify response variables suited to logistic regression.
- Explain the link between probability, odds, and the logit function.
- Fit a basic logistic model in R.

## Core ideas

Logistic regression models the log-odds of an event as a linear function
of predictors. The model guarantees predicted probabilities stay between
0 and 1 while allowing flexible relationships on the logit scale.

## First model in R

```{r}
# Binary outcome: am (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
fit <- glm(am ~ wt, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
summary(fit)
```

## Practice prompts

- What does a positive slope on `wt` imply for the probability of a
  manual transmission?
- How would you describe the model in one sentence to a non-technical
  audience?
