# Course Overview {.unnumbered}

## Who this course is for

This short course is for graduate learners who want an intuition-first introduction to logistic regression and the confidence to fit and interpret models in R. We keep the math light and focus on practical interpretation.

## What you will learn

- Recognize when logistic regression is appropriate for binary outcomes.
- Translate between probability, odds, and log-odds.
- Fit logistic models in R with `glm()` and read the output.
- Interpret coefficients as odds ratios and communicate effects clearly.
- Assess model performance with likelihood measures and classification metrics.

## Prerequisites

- You have completed the Linear Regression short course (or equivalent).
- You can run basic R scripts and read simple model summaries.

## Course map

- Module 1: Logistic regression fundamentals (outcomes, odds, logit, first model).
- Module 2: Odds ratios and interpretation (effects, scenarios, categorical predictors).
- Module 3: Model assessment and diagnostics (deviance, AIC, confusion matrix, thresholds).
- Module 4: Extensions and mini case study (multivariable models, interactions, reporting).

## How to use this book

- Each module introduces a compact set of concepts with worked R examples.
- Follow the interpretation steps after each model fit and practice with the prompts.
- The final module provides a reusable template for your own datasets.
