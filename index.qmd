# Course Overview {.unnumbered}

## Who this course is for

This short course is for graduate learners who want an intuition-first introduction to logistic regression and the confidence to fit and interpret models in R.

## What you will learn

- Understand the difference between linear and logistic regression.
- Recognize when logistic regression is appropriate for binary outcomes.
- Translate between probability, odds, and log-odds.
- Fit logistic models in R with `glm()` and read the output.
- Interpret coefficients as odds ratios and communicate effects clearly.
- Assess model performance with likelihood measures and classification metrics.
- Make predictions and evaluate classification accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- You have completed the Linear Regression short course (or equivalent).
- You can run basic R scripts and read simple model summaries.

## Course map

- Motivation: when to use logistic regression (and when linear regression fails).
- Introduction to logistic regression (GLMs, odds/logit, logistic function).
- Fitting logistic regression models (estimation, interpretation, inference).
- Assessing model fit (deviance, model comparison, pseudo R-squared).
- Predictions from logistic regression models (probabilities, thresholds, ROC/AUC).
- Extensions and mini case study (optional: multivariable models, interactions, reporting).

## How to use this book

- Each module introduces a compact set of concepts with worked R examples.
- Follow the interpretation steps after each model fit and practice with the prompts.
