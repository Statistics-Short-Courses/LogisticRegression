## Learning outcomes

- Convert between probabilities and odds.
- Interpret logistic regression coefficients as odds ratios.
- Generate predicted probabilities for new cases.

## Coefficients as odds ratios

A one-unit increase in a predictor multiplies the odds by
`exp(coefficient)` when other variables are held constant.

```{r}
fit <- glm(am ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
exp(coef(fit))
```

## Predicted probabilities

```{r}
new_cars <- data.frame(wt = c(2.2, 3.5), hp = c(110, 110))
prob <- predict(fit, newdata = new_cars, type = "response")
prob
```

## Practice prompts

- How do the odds change when weight increases by 0.5?
- Why is it misleading to interpret logistic coefficients directly on the
  probability scale?
